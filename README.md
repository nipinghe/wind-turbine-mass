This repo presents an open-source tool to estimate mass and efficiency of wind turbine power take-off components. 
Data from literature and device manufacturers are collected for the following components:
* Gearbox
    * Multi-stage
    * Single-stage
* Bearings
* Generators
    * Induction Generator
    * Synchronous Generator
    * Permanent Magnet Generator
    * Superconducting Generator
    * Hydraulic Systems

At the moment, a GUI is designed using Matlab, but it is planned to develop a web application using [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/).
Users are encouraged to add new data sets for better estimation.

For a detailed description of the work, please refer to [IET Renewable Power Generation Conference](http://www.ietrpg.org/), Bejing, 2013 proceedings.
