\authoraddr{Author Affiliation(s)}

\maketitle

\keywords
Maximum 5 keywords placed before the abstract.

\abstract
This is where the abstract should be placed. It should
consist of one paragraph and a concise summary of the
material discussed in the article below. It is preferable not

The proceedings for IE 07 will contain all the accepted
papers following the peer review process. Authors are
asked to prepare and submit the {\bf PDF} electronic versions
of their full papers according to the instructions below.

\section{Manuscript preparation}
Full papers must be typed in English. The title of the
paper is typed in CAPITAL LETTERS (boldface 18pt)
and centred on the page. The author's name is typed in
capital and lower case bold letters and centred on the
page. Directly under the author's name in capital and
lower case letters and also centred is the author's
affiliation, address, plus e-mail address and fax number of
(at least) the corresponding author. Manuscripts must be
typed single spaced using 10 point characters. Only
Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman and Symbol
fonts are accepted. The text should be typed on an A4
paper (21 cm x 29.7 cm). The paper should have margins
of 2.4 cm from top and bottom and 2 cm from left and
right. Paragraphs are separated by 6 points and with no
indentation. The text of the full papers is written in two
columns and justified. Each column has a width of 8.3 cm
and the columns are separated by a margin of 0.4 cm. The
maximum length of the full paper is 8 pages, of the short
and the demo paper 4 pages. Do not number the pages.
The final format in which the papers will appear on the
CD ROM will be a PDF file. Authors are requested to send
a PDF file of their final paper to be included directly
in the CD ROM.

\subsection{Figures and tables}
Figures and tables should be centred in the column,
numbered consecutively throughout the text, and each
should have a caption underneath it (see for example
Table~\ref{tab1}). Care should be taken that the lettering
is not too small. All figures and tables should be included
in the electronic versions of the full paper.


\begin{table}[htb!]
\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
{\em n} & {\em n!} \\
\hline
1 & 1  \\
2 & 2  \\
3  & 6\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{tab1}This is an example of a table caption.}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Equations}
Equations should be typed within the text, centred, and
should be numbered consecutively throughout the text.
They should be referred to in the text as Equation (n).
Their numbers should be typed in parentheses, flush right,
as in the following example.
\begin{equation}
	    PA + A'P - PBR^{-1}B'P + Q  =  0 \enspace.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{References}
The list of references should be ordered alphabetically
according to the first author surname. All references
should be cited in the text, and using square brackets such
as \cite{ref01} and \cite{ref02}.

\section{Generating a {PDF} file}
The PDF format will be the final format under which the
papers will appear in the {CD ROM}. You {\bf SHOULD}
submit your paper as {PDF} document.

\section{Electronic submission of the full paper}
You should submit your {PDF} file which should adhere to
the above format via the conference paper submission
system.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
The acknowledgement for funding organisations etc.
should be placed in a separate section at the end of the
text. Thank you for your cooperation in complying with
these instructions.
